## Developer Guide

### Introduction
Dine Hub is a restaurant management system designed to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. This guide provides developers with detailed information on architecture, features, development roadmap, and best practices.
### 2. System Architecture
2.1 Tech Stack
-	Frontend (Web): React
- Frontend (Mobile): Flutter
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), MongoDB, Firebase (Firestore)
- Other Integrations: AI-based recommendations, AR/VR menus, payment processing

2.2 Database Strategy (Polyglot Persistence)
 Dine Hub uses a combination of SQL, MongoDB, and Firebase to optimize performance and scalability:
* Feature	SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)	MongoDB (NoSQL)	Firebase (Firestore)
* Data Structure	Relational (tables)	Document-based (JSON)	Real-time NoSQL
* Scalability	Scales vertically	Scales horizontally	Highly scalable (serverless)
* Real-time Sync	❌ No	✅ Yes (with change streams)	✅ Yes
* Query Flexibility	Complex queries (joins, transactions)	Flexible schema, fast reads	Simple, real-time queries
* Performance	Fast for structured data	High-speed for unstructured data	Optimized for real-time apps
* Best Use Case	Complex relationships (users, payments)	Dynamic and fast-growing data	Real-time updates (orders, reservations)

How Each Database is Used:
1.	SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) – Best for structured data:
   - User authentication & role management
   - Payment processing & billing
   - Historical reports & analytics

2.	MongoDB – Best for dynamic and semi-structured data:
   - Menu management (frequent changes)
   - Customer feedback & reviews
   - AI-based recommendations (tracking user preferences)

3.	Firebase (Firestore/Realtime DB) – Best for real-time data:-
   - Live order tracking & updates
   - Table reservations with instant availability checks
   - Inventory updates with real-time alerts

Example Integration:
-	A customer places an order → Firebase updates orders in real-time.
-	Order is completed → Data is stored in MongoDB for analytics.
-	Payment is processed → SQL stores the transaction securely.
This hybrid approach ensures a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly restaurant management system.

### 6. Database Schema & API Endpoints
####User Table
Column	Type	Description
id	String	Unique user ID
name	String	User's full name
email	String	Email address
role	String	Admin, Staff, or Customer
#### Orders Table
Column	Type	Description
order_id	String	Unique order ID
user_id	String	Customer placing the order
items	JSON	List of items ordered
status	String	Pending, Preparing, Served

API Endpoints
-	User Authentication: POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login
-	Order Management: POST /api/orders, GET /api/orders/:id, PUT /api/orders/:id
-	Reservations: POST /api/reservations, GET /api/reservations/:id
-	Payments: POST /api/payments/charge
### 7. Coding Standards & Best Practices
-	Follow consistent code formatting (Prettier, ESLint for JavaScript, Dart Formatter for Flutter).
-	Use meaningful variable and function names.
-	Keep functions small and single-purpose.
-	Implement modular programming for reusability.
### 8. Error Handling & Logging
-	Use centralized error handling in Express.js:
``` app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
}); ```

-	Implement proper try-catch blocks and log errors in Firebase & MongoDB.
-	Store error logs in a monitoring tool like Sentry:
  ``` const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');
      Sentry.init({ dsn: 'your_sentry_dsn' }); ```

-	Use centralized error handling in Express.js.
-	Implement proper try-catch blocks and log errors in Firebase & MongoDB.
-	Store error logs in a monitoring tool like Sentry.
### 9. Security Considerations
-	Implement JWT authentication for user sessions:
  ``` const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
      const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, 'your_secret_key', { expiresIn: '1h' }); ```

-	Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
-	Restrict API access using role-based authorization.
-	Store passwords securely with bcrypt:
  ``` const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10); ```

-	Implement JWT authentication for user sessions.
-	Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
-	Restrict API access using role-based authorization.
-	Store passwords securely with bcrypt.
### 10. Third-Party Integrations
-	Payment Processing: Stripe/PayPal for secure transactions.
-	AI Services: TensorFlow.js for smart recommendations.
-	Messaging & Notifications: Twilio for SMS, Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
### 11. Testing Strategy
-	Unit Tests: Jest for JavaScript, Flutter Test for mobile.
-	Integration Tests: Postman for API endpoints.
-	Automated Testing: GitHub Actions for CI/CD testing before deployment.
-	Example Jest test for an API endpoint:
``` test('GET /api/orders should return orders', async () => {
    const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/orders');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('orders');
}); ```

-	Unit Tests: Jest for JavaScript, Flutter Test for mobile.
-	Integration Tests: Postman for API endpoints.

### 12. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
-	Code Repository: GitHub/GitLab for version control.
-	Build & Deploy: Use Docker for containerized deployments.
-	Automated Deployments: GitHub Actions or Firebase Hosting for continuous deployment.
-	Example GitHub Actions workflow:
  ``` name: CI/CD Pipeline
      on: [push]
      jobs:
        build:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
